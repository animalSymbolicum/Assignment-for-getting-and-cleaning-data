This repository contains the following files:

* run_analysis.R

* CodeBook.Rmd

* meanByAcitivityandIDSummary.txt

Run_analysis.R merges training and test data from the 'UCI HAR Dataset'. It then creates 
a subset of this data and cleans it. Afterwards it summerizes the new dataset with the average of
each variable for each activity and each subject. The result is saved as 'meanByAcitivityandIDSummary.txt'. 

The CodeBook.Rmd describes the 'UCI HAR Dataset' and the the processing steps in 
run_analysis.R. 

meanByAcitivityandIDSummary.txt is a dataset of the avarages for each variable for
each activity and subject.
